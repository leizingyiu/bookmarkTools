### Taobao on the PC side has really high requirements for eyesight. . . Oops

The options on the product detail page are smaller than the nail of the little finger?  
And need to click them one by one to see the big picture?  
Use this bookmark, zoom in all, and load all the big pictures at the same time, cool!
