### Copy=load the magazine, paste=fire!

When you need to paste many pieces of text in batches,
I donâ€™t want to choose to copy back and forth,
So I got this.

Please let me know if there is one ready

Instructions:  
Copy a text
Click this bookmark
Paste into it
Every time you click the button, or alt+c
Just cut away the first line

Although it is very rookie, but please sign it for reprintingðŸ˜‚
