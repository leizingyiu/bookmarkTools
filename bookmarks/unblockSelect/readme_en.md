### Some pages do not allow text selection?

<p style='text-align:center'>
<video   width='80%' autoplay muted controls src='https://pic.leizingyiu.net/bookmark%20tools_unblockSelect.mp4'></video>
</p>

It is found that many bookmark scripts that remove the selected restriction only remove the event restriction;
On some pages, the user-select attribute of css is used to restrict specific areas.
So I added a css unlock to these scripts.

I just added a map function, please feel free to reprint
